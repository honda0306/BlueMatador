// Write two functions to interact with the Chuck Norris public API for jokes found here:
// https://api.chucknorris.io/

// The first function takes as input the joke category (string) and returns a joke (string) from the
// API. If the category isn’t valid, according to the API, return null.



// The second function takes as input a string, searches for jokes containing that string, and
// returns one of the returned jokes.
