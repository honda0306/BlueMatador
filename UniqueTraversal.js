// Write a function that traverses a graph by visiting every edge exactly once and prints out the
// nodes visited in the order of their traversal. If this is impossible, return null.

// For bonus points, return all the correct, unique paths instead of a single one.

// A couple things to note:
// ● Nodes may be visited more than once, edges may not.
// ● If a node cannot be traversed, that is fine. Only the edges must be visited exactly once.
// ● All edges are bidirectional, and only need to be traversed in a single direction

// The input will be a series of lines, separated by newlines ‘\n’. Each line will have node names
// separated by spaces ‘ ‘. An edge exists between the first node and every subsequent node on
// the line.

// The output will be an ordered list of nodes traversed by visiting every edge exactly once.
